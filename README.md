# DNS_spoofer
This Python3 script demonstrates a Man-In-the-Middle (MITM) attack technique known as DNS spoofing. In a typical MITM scenario, when the victim attempts to access a specific website, the script intercepts DNS requests and redirects the victim to a malicious site hosted by the attacker instead of the legitimate destination.
